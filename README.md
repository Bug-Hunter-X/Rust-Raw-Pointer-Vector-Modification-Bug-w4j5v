This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: directly manipulating a vector's contents using a raw pointer. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify the first element of a vector through a raw pointer.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or panics if the vector's capacity is changed or if other parts of the code modify the vector concurrently. The solution `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates safer alternatives using vector indexing or other Rust-idiomatic approaches.
